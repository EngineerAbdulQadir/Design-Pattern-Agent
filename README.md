# Design Pattern Agent – Roadmap (First Agent)

This explains how the **Design Pattern Agent** operates in a **multi-agent system**—involving **Design Agent**, **Review Agent**, and **Refactoring Agent**—while incorporating **voice interaction**. It outlines each step, showing how tasks flow from one agent to another and how the final output is produced.

## **1. Overview of Multi-AI Agents**

1. **Design Agent**  
   - **Role:** Enforces Anthropic design patterns (helpful, honest, harmless, grounded).  
   - **Task:** `ApplyAnthropicPattern` – checks and/or generates code that aligns with best practices.

2. **Review Agent**  
   - **Role:** Audits the code or generated outputs for architectural compliance and quality.  
   - **Task:** `ReviewDesignPattern` – provides a structured review report on the codebase.

3. **Refactoring Agent**  
   - **Role:** Applies recommended changes or improvements.  
   - **Task:** `ProposeRefactoringPlan` – outputs specific refactoring steps or code updates.

These three agents **work together** in a **CrewAI** flow to maintain code quality and design consistency.

## **2. Step-by-Step Workflow**

### **Step 1: Voice Input**
- **File:** `design.py`  
- **Process:**  
  1. The system **greets** you and **listens** for a problem statement (via `voice_interaction()` in `design_crew.py`).  
  2. If **no voice input** is recognized, it **defaults** to a pre-set problem statement:  
     > "Analyze the given codebase, detect applicable design patterns, suggest improvements based on Anthropic guidelines, and provide a structured refactoring plan."

### **Step 2: Create & Update the Task Description**
- **File:** `design.py` (in `DesignFlow.crew_run()`)  
- **Process:**  
  1. Instantiates a **DesignCrew** object.  
  2. The first task, `apply_anthropic_pattern`, is **updated** to include the **user’s problem**.  
  3. This ensures the **Design Agent** has the latest context before starting its checks.

### **Step 3: Run the Multi-Agent Crew**
- **File:** `design_crew.py` (in `DesignCrew.crew()`)  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Design Agent** (Task 1: `ApplyAnthropicPattern`) – Enforces or checks Anthropic guidelines, possibly generating or modifying code.  
  2. **Review Agent** (Task 2: `ReviewDesignPattern`) – Examines the output from Task 1, providing a review of compliance with design patterns, architecture, and best practices.  
  3. **Refactoring Agent** (Task 3: `ProposeRefactoringPlan`) – Uses the review findings to propose or partially implement refactoring steps.

### **Step 4: Final Output & Voice Interaction**
- **File:** `design.py` (in `DesignFlow.crew_run()`)  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Collect** the final output from all three tasks (`output.raw`).  
  2. **Asks** if you want the final results **read aloud** (speech synthesis via `pyttsx3`).  
  3. Saves the **output** to `DesignPattern.md`.  

Example Flow:
1. **You**: State a problem (e.g., “Please ensure the code uses a layered architecture and highlight any anti-patterns.”)  
2. **Design Agent**: Generates or checks code for Anthropic patterns.  
3. **Review Agent**: Audits the code, listing improvements needed.  
4. **Refactoring Agent**: Provides a structured plan to fix or enhance the code.  
5. **System**: Offers to read the final plan aloud and writes it to `DesignPattern.md`.

## **3. Integration with Other Agents**

### **Why Integration?**
- In a **multi-agent** setup, you might have **Knowledge RAG Agent**, **Payment Agent**, or **UI Integration Agent**. The **Design Pattern Agent** can **share** or **request** information through a **Integration Agent** or a **communication broker**.

### **Potential Link Points**
1. **Knowledge RAG Agent**  
   - The **Design Agent** might query a knowledge base for the latest style guides or architectural references.  
   - The **Review Agent** might fetch historical design reviews to see if repeated issues occur.

2. **Payment Agent**  
   - If you’re monetizing code reviews or design pattern enforcement, the **Integration Agent** can notify the Payment Agent about completed tasks.

3. **UI Integration Agent**  
   - Instead of purely voice-based, you can present a **visual** interface showing each step’s progress.  
   - A Next.js UI might let users see real-time logs or read final reports online.

## **4. Running the Design Pattern Agent**

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Ensure `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` are included.

2. **Launch the Flow**  
   ```bash
   python design.py
   ```
   - The system will **speak** a greeting and wait for your problem statement.  
   - If you’re using `uv` scripts (in `pyproject.toml`), you can run:
     ```bash
     uv run design_pattern_agent
     ```

3. **Interact via Voice**  
   - State your **problem** or remain silent to use the **default**.  
   - The agent processes your request, updates tasks, and runs through **Design**, **Review**, and **Refactoring**.

4. **Review the Results**  
   - Check **`DesignPattern.md`** for the final output.  
   - If you said “**yes**” to reading the output, the system will read it aloud.

## **5. Step-by-Step Benefits**

1. **Voice Interaction** – Encourages **hands-free** usage and a more **natural** user experience.  
2. **Multi-Agent Collaboration** – Each agent specializes in a **unique** step (Design, Review, Refactoring), improving code quality.  
3. **Anthropic Compliance** – Ensures your code follows **helpful, honest, harmless, grounded** guidelines.  
4. **Future Scalability** – Easily add or modify tasks/agents for new design patterns, advanced knowledge retrieval, or UI integrations.

---

## **6. Future Improvements**

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Make each design check a separate “handler” for clearer extension.  
- **Dependency Injection**: Improve testability and modularity by injecting LLMs or knowledge bases.  
- **RAG & Memory Agents**: Store design decisions or historical reviews for more **context-aware** suggestions.  
- **UI Dashboard**: Provide real-time status updates in a web interface (Next.js or similar).

## **7. Conclusion**

By **step-by-step** chaining the **Design Agent**, **Review Agent**, and **Refactoring Agent**, your **Design Pattern Agent** ensures:
1. **Design Patterns** are enforced or suggested.  
2. **Quality Reviews** are generated.  
3. **Refactoring Plans** are implemented or provided.  

Voice interaction makes the entire process more **user-friendly**. As you expand to more specialized agents (Integration, Payment, Knowledge RAG), this architecture will **scale**—maintaining high-quality design across all corners of your multi-agent ecosystem.
